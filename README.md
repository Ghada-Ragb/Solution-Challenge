Solution Challenge - Google Developer Student Clubs EELU Assiut 

Communication is the biggest challenge, but with 'Hear my signs', anything is possible. Our team has achieved a great accomplishment by winning the second place in the Google Developer Student Clubs EELU Assiut competition. Our application provides innovative solutions to empower the deaf and mute to fully participate in society. Through teaching sign language, translating speech and video, we strive to build a more inclusive world.
